Metric Realease Notes

Version 2.1 (current) - May 4, 2012
 - Fixed an error that occured when either reconstruction file contained a bifurcation at the second node/compartment. The error was a NullPointerException at line 410 of ReadSWC, method findParentTrajectory.
 - Readme correction (June 27, 2012), fixing the description of the dataset parameter (not required after the post-competition release).

Version 2.0 (post-competition) - January 13, 2011
 - Provides input parameters for setting threshold values.
 - Provides input parameter for choosing one of four score weighting schemes.
 - Provides input parameter for setting a minimum terminal branch length (for removing "spurs").
 - Provides input parameters for listing nodes missed by the test reconstruction, nodes scored as "continuations", nodes scored as "distant matches", and excess nodes in the test reconstruction.

Previous versions released during the competition fixed various bugs.
